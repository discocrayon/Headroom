Always put data sources in a separate data.tf file
Never do except Exception, always catch the specific exceptions that the code can raise
Try and search online first rather than try to use the AWS CLI to figure something out.
Always add type annotations, ensuring mypy will be satisfied
Always add tests, and then run tox
Split docstrings over multiple lines for readability and PEP 257 compliance.
Write everything I tell you to a file called conversation_history.md, with the date and time included. Make sure the date is today's date. I want posterity for all of our conversations. I don't want you to overwrite what is already there. Do not leave trailing whitespace in the file.
Wrap with statements in parentheses to avoid the backslash-newline continuation. Make sure to make sure to not put the patch right after the open parenthesis but instead make a newline, and dedent all the lines inside the parenthesis, add a trailing comma as well.
Never do dynamic imports, always try to import at the top of the file. If it is absolutely impossible to get away without a dynamic import, add a comment above the line of the import with justification.
Do not define functions inside of functions. Prioritize keeping indentation to a minimum.
Per the E226 python linting rule, do not miss whitespace around arithmetic operators
Do not do imports inside of functions.
Top-level imports only
Use continue and return with if statements in order to reduce indentation
Think like the Clean Code guy
If you hardcode a default value, in `config.py`, do not hardcode it again within the codebase.
Command line arguments should be set once, including default values, and then used downstream. Never duplicate default values for something that is a CLI argument.
In Terraform, the syntax is "local." to access locals, not "locals."
You must not set a default value for something that is set via CLI except in `config.py`.
Never rename imported things with "as" ever
Do not add stray blank lines randomly
Never do an import inside of a function
Do not overengineer, for example, making new types with one attribute, or a new class with one function
Do not use the type of Any, if you change the existing code to Any, you are making it worse.
Never commit without asking me first.
Do not commit without asking me first.
Be specific. Do not say, for example, "and other formats" list the formats explictly instead.
Always import at the top of the file.
Never use dynamic imports
Do not add extra defensive checks or try/catch blocks
Only specify the value of keyword arguments if the value being passed is different from the default
